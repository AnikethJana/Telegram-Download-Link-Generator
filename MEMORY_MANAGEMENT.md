# Memory Management Features

This document explains the memory leak prevention features added to StreamBot.

## ðŸ§  Memory Leak Fixes Implemented

### 1. Smart Rate-Limited Logger (`utils/smart_logger.py`)
**Problem**: The original rate-limited logger had an unbounded cache that grew indefinitely.

**Solution**: 
- Cache size limit (default: 1000 entries)
- Periodic cleanup every 30 minutes
- Automatic removal of old entries

**Usage**: Automatically integrated, no changes needed.

### 2. Stream Resource Tracking (`utils/stream_cleanup.py`)
**Problem**: HTTP streaming connections not properly cleaned up on client disconnections.

**Solution**:
- Track all active streaming tasks
- Context manager for automatic cleanup
- Proper resource disposal on errors/cancellation

**Usage**: Automatically integrated in download routes.

### 3. Memory Manager (`utils/memory_manager.py`)
**Problem**: No monitoring of memory usage or periodic cleanup.

**Solution**:
- Memory usage monitoring with psutil
- Periodic garbage collection
- Memory usage logging at key points

**Features**:
- Real-time memory statistics
- Automatic cleanup every hour
- Memory usage in API endpoints

### 4. Cleanup Scheduler (`utils/cleanup_scheduler.py`)
**Problem**: Cleanup tasks (bandwidth, memory) not running reliably.

**Solution**:
- Dedicated background scheduler
- Multiple cleanup tasks with different intervals:
  - Daily: Bandwidth record cleanup
  - Hourly: Memory/garbage collection
  - 10min: Stream connection cleanup

**Benefits**:
- Ensures cleanup tasks always run
- Prevents accumulation of old data
- Graceful shutdown handling

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & API Changes

### New Telegram Command
Admins can now check memory usage via the `/memory` command in Telegram:

```
/memory
```

This shows:
- RSS and VMS memory usage in MB
- Memory percentage usage
- Active streaming connections
- Number of Telegram clients
- Logger cache status
- System uptime
- Automatic cleanup schedule info

### API Changes
The `/api/info` endpoint has been cleaned up and no longer includes system memory information to keep it lightweight.

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

All features are enabled by default with sensible settings:

- **Memory cleanup**: Every 1 hour
- **Stream cleanup**: Every 10 minutes  
- **Bandwidth cleanup**: Every 24 hours
- **Logger cache limit**: 1000 entries

No environment variables needed - everything works out of the box!

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

With these fixes, you should see:

1. **Stable Memory Usage**: Memory should stabilize after initial startup
2. **No Gradual Increase**: Memory usage shouldn't grow continuously over days
3. **Better Performance**: Faster response times due to cleanup
4. **Proper Cleanup**: Resources cleaned up even on client disconnections

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring Memory Usage

Monitor via:
- **Telegram Command**: `/memory` for admins - real-time memory stats in chat
- **Logs**: Regular memory usage reports at startup, client start, web server start, and shutdown
- **API**: `/api/info` endpoint for general bot info (memory info removed for cleaner API)
- **System**: Standard monitoring tools (htop, etc.)

The bot should now run indefinitely without memory leaks! ðŸŽ‰
