## Resource Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended | High Traffic |
|-----------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| RAM | 1 GB | 2 GB | 4+ GB |
| CPU | 1 vCPU | 2 vCPU | 4+ vCPU |
| Storage | 25 GB | 50 GB | 100+ GB |
| Bandwidth | 100 GB/month | 500 GB/month | 1+ TB/month |
| MongoDB | Shared | Dedicated | Replicated |

## Deployment Architecture

StreamBot can be deployed in various configurations depending on your needs:

### Basic Deployment

```mermaid
graph TD
    User[User] -->|Access| Server[VPS/Cloud Server]
    Server -->|Contains| App[StreamBot Application]
    Server -->|Contains| DB[(MongoDB Database)]
    App -->|Uses| TG[Telegram API]
```

This simple setup is suitable for personal or small-scale use.

### Production Deployment

```mermaid
graph TD
    User[User] -->|Access| LB[Load Balancer/Nginx]
    LB -->|Routes to| App1[StreamBot Instance 1]
    LB -->|Routes to| App2[StreamBot Instance 2]
    App1 -->|Uses| DB[(MongoDB Cluster)]
    App2 -->|Uses| DB
    App1 -->|Uses| TG[Telegram API]
    App2 -->|Uses| TG
```

This configuration provides better reliability and scalability for production use.

## Environment Configuration

All deployment methods require proper environment configuration. The following variables are essential:

```bash
# Required Configuration
API_ID=your_api_id
API_HASH=your_api_hash
BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
LOG_CHANNEL=your_log_channel_id
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://username:password@host:port/database
BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```
