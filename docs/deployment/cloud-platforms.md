cd Telegram-Download-Link-Generator
heroku create your-streambot-app
heroku config:set API_ID=your_api_id
heroku config:set API_HASH=your_api_hash
# ... set other environment variables
git push heroku main
```

### Railway (Simple Deployment)

- Monitoring and logging setup

## Cost Optimization Tips

While we prepare detailed guides, consider:

- **Free Tiers**: Start with free tiers from major cloud providers
- **Spot Instances**: Use spot/preemptible instances for cost savings
- **Auto-scaling**: Implement auto-scaling to handle traffic spikes
- **CDN Usage**: Use CDNs for global file distribution
- **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor usage to optimize costs
