# Introduction to StreamBot

StreamBot is a powerful Telegram bot that generates direct download links for files sent to it. It allows you to share files of any size through Telegram, providing recipients with direct download links that don't require a Telegram account to access.

## What StreamBot Does

StreamBot solves a common problem: sharing large files through Telegram in a way that anyone can access them. When you send a file to StreamBot, it:

1. Processes the file securely
2. Stores it using Telegram's infrastructure
3. Generates a direct download link
4. Manages bandwidth and download limits
5. Tracks usage statistics
